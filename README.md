# Credit card approval prediction

My solution to the Kaggle challenge [Credit card approval prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction). This was conducted as a take-home assignment within a time limit of 3 hours as part of the application process for a major banking company in Germany.

To rerun the notebook from top to bottom, make a folder ``data`` and download the two CSV datasets there. The results from the notebook can then be reproduced.
